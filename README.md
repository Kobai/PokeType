# PokeType

PokeType: Convolutional Neural Network that predicts a pokemon's primary type based on its appearence. Training and testing data are sprites from generations 1-5.

StatAnalysis: An MLP network that predicts a pokemon's primary type based on its base stats (hp, attack, defense, sp. attack, sp. defense, speed). It turns out that there are very strong base stat trends that pokemon of certain types follow, resulting in the testing accuracy of the model being consistently ~90% (can probably go higher too)
